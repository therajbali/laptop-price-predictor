# Airbnb Listings Analysis – German Market

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listing data from a German city to identify 
patterns related to availability, room types, neighborhoods, and host behavior.

The goal is to generate data-driven insights that can help Airbnb hosts 
better understand market competition and make informed listing management decisions
within a regulated environment.

- Strategic choice of room types
